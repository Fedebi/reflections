1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository the system creates a .git directory that is a hidden directory where will be stored all metadata necessary to track the info for every commits. I need to do this because a directory normally is not a git repository, it becomes a repository only if you execute a specific command (git init)

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area contains only the files i selected to will be committed. The staging area offer to me the possibility to select with accuracy the files to commit.
