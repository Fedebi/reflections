Fede's Version Control Lesson 1 Reflections

1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was helpful because you can see the difference and then note if there are some typo. 

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  
	Because you can restore some old file if you have had a mistake and moreover you can read the whole code history. 

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	I think the commit is a personal operation and different people can do "commit" in a different way but anyway is better because the version commit is always a run version instead a version saved automatically that might be contains several errors.

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	I think Git was born for handle shared big project where all files are concatenated with each others. Instead the Google Docs don't have relation with other document.

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	First with the command "git log" I can find the recent "commit Ids" and then I can select two of these Ids and with the "git diff" I find all the change.
6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	I think the programmer is more relaxed with this typo of control.

7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	I would like to see how to checkout a repository with message.
